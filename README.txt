Integrated, browser native, operating-system-like
environment offering per-process namespaces, locality
transparency, and idiomatic file-like interfaces to all
system objects.

running an instance of coolprototype-9000/shell-web-app in dev mode.
Once there, build cp9psrv by issuing `make` and then run it. Connect
